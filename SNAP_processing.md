# PSI Processing in SNAP
The steps associated with Sentinel processing are:
1. Performing a TOPS Split
2. Applying the orbit file
3. Choosing the primary and secondary images
4. Coregistration of the secondary data files to the primary
5. Enhanced spectral diversity
6. Interferogram generation and coherance estimation
7. Debursting
8. Exporting for applying to StaMPS
