# INSAR Processing for TOPS Data
There are two options if you'd like to run step by step
1. Follow instructions in ```isce_topstack.md``` file
2. Activate the isce environment and run the ```run_this.sh``` file as ```sh run_this.sh``` to run all the steps as a batch.

Do note that in both cases, a conversion into DEM has not been done yet. Will get it done shortly.
